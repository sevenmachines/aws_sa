\section{Solution analysis and fixes}

\issue{The site cannot be accessed from external addresses}
{Add everywhere access to load balancer ingress}
{
Allow all addresses to access the load balancer on port 80
}
{}

\issue{Load balancer cannot route to subnet}
{Add PublicSubnetA to load balancer}
{
The ELB can only route to instances in PublicSubnetB. This change
allows it to route to PublicSubnetA also, where the current instance is located.
}
{}

\issue{Instances cannot be accessed from the load balancer}
{Allow access to the instance from the ELB only}
{This change allows traffic from the ELB to the instances}
{}


\issue{ELB healthcheck on wrong instance port}
{Change ELB port for healthcheck from 443 to 80}
{
Httpd starts on-instance on port 80. The ELB correctly forwards ports
from from 80 to instance port 80.  However, the healthcheck looks to verify instance health on port 443 through a tcp connection. This change simply targets the healthcheck correctly at port 80 on the instance.
